heading : "I'm a <span>product designer</span> who enjoys learning from users."

description : "I'm a product designer with a Master of Arts from the Academy of Art University, San Francisco, California. <br><br>With a background in product design and three years of experience in printing industry in Thailand, I decided to study abroad in the United States. Here I was introduced to user interface design, and amazed with the possibility of creating experiences through interactive devices. User testing is very important to me. I love to observe how people react and navigate through prototypes, to listen to what they need. <b>I use that feedback to design visually engaging products.</b>"
