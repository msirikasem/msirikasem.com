heading : "**My name is Melissa Sirikasem.** I'm a designer with a Master of Arts from the Academy of Art University, San Francisco, California."

description : "With a background in product design and three years of experience in printing, I decided to study abroad in the United States. Here I was introduced to user interface design, and amazed with the possibility of creating experiences through interactive devices. User testing is very important to me. I love to observe how people react and navigate through prototypes, to listen to what they need. **I use that feedback to design visually engaging work.**"
