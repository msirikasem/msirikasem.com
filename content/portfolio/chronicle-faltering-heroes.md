Objectives
Design a film festival with multiple deliverables including printed books, poster, packaging, website, motion graphics, environmental graphics, and products. The project objectives are to deliver a complex set of materials that function together as a whole.

Concept
A Chronicle of Faltering Heroes is presented as the first Zack Snyder film festival in California. Snyder's movies are involved with heroes and inspired by comic books. A Chronicle of Faltering Heroes tells a story of a group of heroes who fight, struggle, die or survive in their battles. The visuals of the festival resemble noir graphic novel styles. I use strong contrasting colors including black, white, blue and red. Also, I add a grunge texture along with brush strokes to emphasize the heroes' struggles.
