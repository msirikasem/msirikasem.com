<b>Objectives</b><br>
Rebrand an existing company that is bankrupt or dying. Repurpose the brand, develop the visual system and extend out the brand's products.

<b>Concept</b><br>
Fredericks of Hollywood, the innovative brand for women's undergarments until 1980, is now bankrupt and exists only online. I repurposed the brand's goal to empower women to be confident and targeted a younger audience. I redesigned the logo using a swan to convey the transformation of the awkward baby swan to a strong and elegant grown-up swan. I used pastel colors contrasting with black to show a concept of femininity and power. I chose to design a cosmetic product line as a brand extension.
