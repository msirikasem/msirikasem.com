Objectives
Rebrand an existing company that is bankrupt or dying. Repurpose the brand, develop the visual system and extend out the brand's products.

Concept
Fredericks of Hollywood, the innovative brand for women's undergarments until 1980, is now bankrupt and exists only online. I repurposed the brand's goal to empower women to be confident and targeted a younger audience. I redesigned the logo using a swan to convey the transformation of the awkward baby swan to a strong and elegant grown-up swan. I used pastel colors contrasting with black to show a concept of femininity and power. I chose to design a cosmetic product line as a brand extension.
