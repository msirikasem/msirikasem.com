<h3>Problems</h3>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8">
			<h4>Scalable was losing sellers to competitors for not providing product customization on Chip, an eCommerce platform.</h4>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8">
			<p>Product customization is a rapidly rising trend in the print-on-demand market. Consumers value items that can convey individuality for the person who bought or received them as a gift. Our merchants requested the ability to create personalizable products. We were seeing a pattern of sellers leaving our platform because we didn't offer customization.</p><br>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8">
			<p>Personalized text project involved three different platforms: seller-side platform, buyer-side marketplace, and customer service platform. To make this case study more concise, we will focus on the seller-side platform and buyer-side marketplace.</p>

<h5>Kick-off</h5>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8">
			<p>Customizable text for print-on-demand products was the most requested feature at this time, based on customer feedback. The data team also conducted market research to validate the revenue potential. Afterward, I started this project by conducting a competitive analysis to help the team prioritize which functionality we should offer in each phase.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<br>

<div style="text-align:center;">
	<p><img src="/images/projects/personalized-text/competitors-analysis.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="competitors analysis"></p>
	<i>&#9757;&#127995; I compared our competitors features for text personalization and used that to prioritize our product offers</i><br><br>
</div>
<br>

<h5>Iterations</h5>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8">
			<h4 class="cs-emphasis-header">Sell-side</h4>
			<p>I worked on the seller side first, as it is the most complex part. We needed to consider fulfillment aspects, as we have a mix of in-house and 3rd parties to produce customization products seamlessly. We ensured product mockups on the back end match designs that the merchant created, to show buyers a preview that matches the final product that they will get as close as possible. I listed the user flow total of 26 use cases to predict potential edge cases that systems need to prevent.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">
	<p><img src="/images/projects/personalized-text/sell-side-sketches.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="sell-side sketches"></p>
	<i>&#9757;&#127995; I drew different user flows to determine the approach that we should move forward with for high fidelity mockups</i><br><br>
</div>
<br>

<div style="text-align:center;">
	<p><img src="/images/projects/personalized-text/sell-side-iterations.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="sell-side iterations"></p>
	<i>&#9757;&#127995; I explored customized tool placement and decided to redesign the page layout</i><br><br>
</div>
<br>

<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8">
			<h4 class="cs-emphasis-header">Buy-side</h4>
			<p>I researched our competitors, looking for inspiration, and then created a rough wireframe to discuss feasibility with the development team early on. Project managers wanted a way to disable features if they hurt conversion, so we built the experience in a modal. 70% of order purchases happen on mobile, so we targeted the mobile experience first, then desktop.</p>

<h5>Usability testing</h5>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8">
			<p>I planned usability testing, prepared clickable mocks, and then gave the materials to the seller support team to conduct testing in Vietnamese. We conducted usability testing with five high-performance sellers who also use personalization tools on other platforms.</p>

	<i>&#9757;&#127995; We changed the "delete all designs" button location as sellers confused it with "delete single design"</i><br><br>
</div>
<br>



<h5>Implementation</h5>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8">
			<p>I worked closely with the engineering team to clarify any team concerns between our system and the design. I then worked on visual quality assurance to make sure the products were working well before launch.</p>
