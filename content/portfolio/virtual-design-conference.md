<b>Objectives</b><br>
Create a visual system for a chosen conference. Explore the usage of systems through posters, signage, tickets, schedule, and digital deliverables. 

<b>Concept</b><br>
I created an original conference called Virtual Design Conference. The conference showcases future digital technology including VR technology, 3D printing, gaming technology, and futuristic products. I use a dot pattern as a graphic element to represent the digital matrix and let that pattern transform into different shapes to represent the digital world. I use white as the main color with bright accents such as blue, yellow or magenta to create a clean futuristic look.
