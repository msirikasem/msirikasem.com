<b>About Chip</b><br>
<a href="https://www.chipchip.com/">Chip</a> is an e-commerce platform specializing in print-on-demand products that offer packing, shipping, and customer services for entrepreneurs. Merchants can create a store, where they can market and sell customized products with their designs.<br>
<br>

<b>Problems</b><br>
Improve seller satisfaction by enabling them to easily bulk-edit products on their stores. Their feedback highlighted several key workflow issues:<br>
&emsp;1. Difficulty making changes to campaign information, such as product descriptions or Facebook Pixel IDs<br>
&emsp;2. Information visible on the main seller dashboard is scattered, making it difficult to find or manage<br>
&emsp;3. No way for merchant team members to customize views according to their role responsibiliites, such as marketing or graphic design<br>
These issues were cited by the seller support team as reasons sellers move to other platforms.<br>
<br>


<b>Goals</b><br>
&emsp;1. Improve overall merchant satisfaction on Chip platform.<br>
&emsp;2. Allow users to <a href="./#customizable_view">customize their campaign list view</a> based on the information they need for their role.<br>
&emsp;3. Enable merchant team members to complete tasks like updating campaigns faster through <a href="./#bulk_edit_name">bulk editing.</a><br>


<b>Process</b><br>
Kick-off &rarr; Iterations &rarr; Usability testing &rarr; Implementation &rarr; Launch
<br>


<b>Results</b><br>
We did user testing with a group of high performance sellers throughout development, for continuous feedback to adjust the product according to merchant needs. This enabled early validation of bulk edit & customizable views as high-value initiatives.<br><br>
During testing, users gave the platform a rating of 4.5 out of 5.<br>
